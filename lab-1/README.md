I wanted to make something that appealed to me and that I would have fun with, which is why I went with Star Wars the Clone Wars. It was pretty easy to find pixelated figures that I wanted to add in. I actually really enjoyed the process of setting the scene. The hardest part of this lab for me was literally just the Github submission and repository creation. Otherwise, I found Godot very easy to use!
